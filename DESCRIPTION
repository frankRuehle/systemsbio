Description: Tools for for analysis and integration of different kinds of omics-
    data. Currently implemented methods refer to gene expression data. Illumina
    microarray data or custom microarray data are loaded into an Expressionet object
    and are normalised and QC-controlled. Limma package is used for differential
    expression analysis of all indicated group comparisons. Differential expressed
    genes are analysed for enriched GO terms, KEGG pathways and transcription factor
    binding sites using clusterProfiler and PWMEnrich. Principal component analysis
    and whole genome coexpression network analysis is performed using WGCNA and
    pcaGoPromoter packages. Methods for methylation analysis, GWAS and QTL analyses
    will be added soon.
